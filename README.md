# Portfolio_hw2

## Description:

For this assignment, I made a basic portfolio with a nav bar in the header that links to different sections of the page contained within my main element tags. I used a placeholder image in the About me section and placed a flexbox to the right of it that shifts down underneath when the page scales to smaller screens. In the "projects" section, I embedded a few videos of audio projects I have completed in the past as placeholders and used my Horiseon project from the first homework assignment as an image that takes you to a link when clicked. I also added a link underneath the image that leads to the same page. Last, I added links in the contact me section that send me an email directly
 or take you to my linkedin page when you click the appropriately named links.
